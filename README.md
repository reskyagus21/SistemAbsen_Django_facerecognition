# Face Attendance System

A face recognition-based attendance system built with Django and the `face_recognition` library. This project allows users to register members, record attendance using a webcam, and manage member and attendance data through a modern interface.

## Features
- **Member Registration**: Add member details (name, address, position) along with a face photo.
- **Automatic Attendance**: Detect faces to record attendance with timestamps and proof images.
- **Data Management**: View, edit, and delete member and attendance records.
- **Print Attendance List**: Export attendance data to a printable format with images.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam for face recognition
- Python dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reskyagus21/AbsenDjango.git

## How To use Attendance System
1. Go to "Capture" to add a new member (fill in details and take a photo)
2. Click "Train Faces" after adding members to update the recognition model.
3. Use "Attendance" to record attendance via webcam.
4. In "List", edit/delete members, delete attendance records, or print the attendance list.
